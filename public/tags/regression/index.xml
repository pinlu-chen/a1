      <description>Abstract Here we investigate how education and province_territory affect the election and find that Ontario province is highly associated with the election; in addition, people with Bachelorâ€™s degree are highly associated with the election.
 Introduction The major task of this paper is to see how education and province_territory affect the election via looking the distributions of the two variables.
Since both of them are categorical variables, we look at the distributions of them via bar charts.</description>
